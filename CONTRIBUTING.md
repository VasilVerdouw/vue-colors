# Contributing to Vue Colors

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests (PR won't be disregarded for a lack of tests in these early stages).
3. If you've changed things that impact documentation (like adding a new operation), update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes & use proper formatting.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under our license
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL-3 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/VasilVerdouw/vue-colors/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/VasilVerdouw/vue-colors/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for some basic style unification

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its GPL-3 License.
