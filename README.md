Choose any colors to highlight either the entire line, the scrollbar or both!

## Features

Vue Colors is meant to bring more clarity to your Vue documents. It highlights your Vue code based on functionality (script, template, style) and allows you to easily see where you are in your Vue documents. This enhances your productivity and makes it easier to navigate through (large) files. Additionally, it makes your code look more organized and visually appealing.

Vue Colors is fully customizable, allowing you to change the colors to whatever you like, and choose what to highlight (the entire line, the scrollbar or both). The extension works with any number of `<template>`, `<script>` and `<style>` tags in any order!
